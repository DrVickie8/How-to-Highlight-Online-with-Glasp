# How to Highlight Online with Glasp - A Beginner's Guide

_Everything you need to know about Glasp as a beginner. Say goodbye to scattered online notes._

With the vast information available on the internet, there is a high tendency to get lost when there is too much to read. Imagine there was a tool that helps you to pick out the most important information and save it in an accessible place. With this tool, you get to highlight on web pages when reading articles, and on PDFs, and it also summarizes long articles and YouTube videos, when you are rushing to get important information.

Glasp, also known as Greatest Legacy Accumulated as Shared Proof, is a free online highlighter that provides an effective way to organize and access information online, making it easier and more productive when reading or researching online.

Glasp aims to solve the problem of isolation of knowledge by encouraging collective learning. It would be a huge loss for the next generation if they can't access what you have learned throughout your life.

## 5 REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD USE GLASP

It can be challenging to keep track of important information and remember where you found it. Glasp solves this problem and takes it further with innovative features that boost your productivity.

Here are 5 reasons you should use Glasp:

1. **Collaboration**: It allows you to share information with others, making it easier to work on group projects with colleagues or classmates.

2. **Easy to remember**: Many online highlighters do not have tagging and note-taking features, which helps you to add more context and make it easier to remember why the information was important.

3. **Saves time**: Contrary to the traditional way of copying and pasting from one webpage to another, Glasp helps you save time by quickly highlighting the content and save for future reference without leaving the webpage.
4. **Referencing and citations**: With Glasp you don't need to write down citations, all you need to do is highlight the content and add the authors directly on the highlight in your profile page. More on this later.
5. **Legacy**: This means leaving a lasting impact on the world. When you write on traditional notes, nobody gets to see your notes and insights, but with Glasp, you can share your knowledge with others. This benefits both you and your audience; it helps others learn and grow, builds your reputation, and can lead to new connections, collaborations, and opportunities.
